# Java2D Game Template

Templates for implementing simple 2D games using the Java programming language.
As part of the "Advanced Programming" course in [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/), 
this project was designed and implemented by [S. M. Ghaffarian](http://linkedin.com/in/smghaffarian),
to help students quickly get started with 2D game-development using the Java language.

This project consists of two different templates:

 1. Template based on classic **Double-Buffering** implementation.
 2. Template based on the more modern **Buffer-Strategy** implementation.

There is also a basic example game implemented using the Buffer-Strategy template.
